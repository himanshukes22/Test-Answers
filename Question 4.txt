Ques 4) Design a mysql database. Requirements are as follows 
             1. We have a user entity with columns username, password
             2. Every use can have multiple addresses. Address entity will have column street, pincode, country, state, phone no. So one user can have multiple 
                addresses. 
        Design a db structure for this using create table sql syntax and submit that.
        Next,
        Write a route in flask or django GET, POST route to save a user, login a user, add/update address for that user.

Solution


mysql> create database db;
Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

mysql> use db;
Database changed

mysql> create table user( username varchar(100) primary key, password varchar(100));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.16 sec)

mysql> create table Address( street varchar(100), pincode varchar(50), country varchar(100), state varchar(100), phone_no varchar(20),username varchar(100), FOR
EIGN KEY(username) REFERENCES user(username));
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.17 sec)
